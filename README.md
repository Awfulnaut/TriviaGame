# TriviaGame
The Trivia Game will take you through several questions, with each question requiring an answer within 30 seconds. When an answer is chosen, or if time runs out, the correct answer will be displayed before moving on to the next question. Once all questions have been answered, Your score will be displayed.

This project was built with jQuery and is maintained by myself. If you have questions or need help, you can reach out to me at cadin.mcqueen@gmail.com.
